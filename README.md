## Project 1: Final Project for Spatial Data Discovery Class, NBA player shot chart
### Overview
Ever since I was a little kid, basketball has been a big part of my life.

When the National Basketball Association(NBA) [cancelled](https://www.nba.com/article/2020/03/11/nba-suspend-season-following-wednesdays-games) the remainder of its 2019-2020 season, due to COVID-19, I was extremely disappointed.

Inspired by posts by [Kirk Goldsberry](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/) and a LA Times graphic about [Kobe Bryant's](https://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/) career shots, I decide to visualize the growth of an NBA player through his shot charts. I thought this project would help fill the void in my life caused by the lack of NBA basketball.

In a reality without COVID NBA playoff games would be occuring right now.
