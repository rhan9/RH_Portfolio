## [Project 1: NBA Player Shot Chart](https://github.com/rhan9/nba_player_shotchart)
### Overview
* Utilized Python and a National Basketball Association(NBA) API Client package called "nba_api" to visualize a player's regular season shot chart. 
* Created a python script to clean and extract the necessary shot location data from the API output.
* Used matplotlib to plot out all of our player's regular season shots since he entered the NBA. 
* A more detailed overview can be found [here](https://spatial-data-discovery.github.io/project-rhan9.html)
