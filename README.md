### [Project 1: NBA Player Shot Chart](https://github.com/rhan9/nba_player_shotchart)
#### Overview
* Utilized Python and a National Basketball Association(NBA) API Client package "nba_api" to visualize Giannis Antetokounmpo's regular season shot chart since he entered the league(2013).

* Created a python script to clean and extract the necessary shot location data from the API output. Data is shown as a Pandas dataframe.

* Python script can be utilized to show similar regular season output for any
current NBA player.

* Used matplotlib to plot out all of our player's regular season shots since he entered the NBA.

* A more detailed overview can be found [here](https://spatial-data-discovery.github.io/project-rhan9.html)
